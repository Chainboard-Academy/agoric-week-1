## Using The Dapp
Our sample dapp demonstrates an auction for baseball cards. Users will place their bids on the cards they want
and after the bid duration ends the highest bidding user will receive the baseball card in their wallet. The bid
duration is 5 mins.

1. Open http://localhost:3000 from your browser. You should see something like below:

2. Then go to the page automatically opened when you execute `agoric open --repl` command. Approve the dapp from the
dashboard.

3. Once the approval is successful you should see the list of baseball cards available.
4. Click on one of the cards and place your bid.
5. Go to your wallet UI and approve the offer.
6. Wait for 5 mins then see your baseball card in your `cardStore.Card` purse.
